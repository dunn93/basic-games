#tuple is like a list for something you wouldn't want to change, ex: coordinates
# tuple is immutable = cannot be changed
# for a list use [] and they can be edited

coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates[1])

#to create a func you have to use def

def say_hi(name):
    print("Hello " + name)

say_hi("Steve")
#parameter is a piece of info you feed the function
# can pass in multiple parameters and any data type just have to convert to string if using strings
